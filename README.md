## Known bugs

---
**macOS specific bug:**  
`"Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException:\
GLFW windows may only be created on the main thread and that thread must be the first thread in the process"`

**Fix for IntelliJ:**  
`run > edit configurations > modify options > add VM options\`
then add line: `"-XstartOnFirstThread"`
